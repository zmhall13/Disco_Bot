This robot will be built to carry 25-30 discs; navigate wooded/open terrain in most conditions the average player could be playing in; keep score; respond to voice commands; and carry other esential items.  This repo is built on Raspbian Buster and ROS Noetic.

## Setup

See the **Setup** folder for instructions to set up the Pi from scratch.  The [README.md](Setup/README.md) lists the order of the instructions to follow.
